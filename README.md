# Fuzzy Self-Driving Car Simulator

## Overview
The Fuzzy Self-Driving Car Simulator is a project designed to simulate the decision-making processes of an autonomous vehicle using fuzzy logic. The simulator emulates real-world driving conditions, focusing on the development and optimization of fuzzy rules to manage obstacles and control speed effectively.

## Features
- **Fuzzy Logic-Based Decision Making**: Implements fuzzy logic principles to handle uncertainties and imprecise information, allowing the car to make human-like decisions in various driving scenarios.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The simulator is equipped with advanced fuzzy rules that enable the car to detect and avoid obstacles dynamically, ensuring safe navigation through complex environments.
- **Speed Control**: The system adjusts the car's speed in response to changing road conditions mimicking real-time decision-making in autonomous driving.
